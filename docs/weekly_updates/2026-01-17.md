## What We Built This Week

### Database Infrastructure
- Set up Airtable base with 2 tables: `people_companies` (11 fields), `people_relationships` (13 fields)
- Implemented bidirectional relationship mapping using linked records
- Added timestamp and accountability fields for data quality tracking
- Created GitHub repository with schema documentation

### Research Methodology
- Established "direct mentions only" principle for relationship verification
- Defined "door opener" criteria (5 validation checkpoints)
- Documented research workflow with time budgets, not yet
- Created decision log (5 ADRs) to track key choices

### First Founder Profile
- **Mao Ching Foo** (RealVantage COO, ex-Funding Societies CTO)
- All relationships have source URLs and working context
- Time spent: should be less than 1 hours (within budget)

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Tech founders first** - Focus on CTOs/VPs over business-focused founders
2. **Skip inactive LinkedIn profiles** - Only profile founders active within 6 months
3. **Use Airtable for MVP** - Relational database without coding overhead, easy to share
4. **LinkedIn URL as primary key** - Natural identifier, prevents duplicates
