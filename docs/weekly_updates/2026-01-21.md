## What We Built This Week

### Newsletter Export Tool (Production Ready)
<!-- Tool for generating HTML newsletters from Airtable data -->
- Built complete HTML/CSS/JS tool at `tools/newsletter-export-tool/`
- **Company Autocomplete Search**: Replaced dropdown with real-time search filtering
- **Rich Text Formatting**: Added bold/italic formatting toolbar for Company News field with keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl/Cmd+B, Ctrl/Cmd+I)
- **Enhanced Newsletter Output**:
  - Underlined hyperlinks in exported HTML
  - Dynamic company name insertion from selected company
  - Source attribution links to original articles
- **Security**: Moved Airtable API keys to gitignored `config.js` file (not in version control)
- Generated first production newsletter: **Saladin** (saved to `docs/newsletters/saladin-newsletter.html`)

### Research Input Tool (Production Ready)
<!-- Interactive tool to generate standardized search strategies -->
- Built multi-step wizard at `tools/research-input-tool/`
- **4-Step Workflow**:
  1. LinkedIn URL validation
  2. Work history extraction
  3. Additional information gathering
  4. Search strategy generation
- Generates standardized Manus AI search strategies for founder relationship mapping
- Follows "direct mentions only" research principle

### GitHub Pages Setup
<!-- Public hosting for newsletters via GitHub Pages -->
- Created landing page at `docs/index.html` with newsletter listing
- Set up public URL structure: `https://[username].github.io/[repo]/newsletters/`
- Branded newsletter links with "TechInAsia.com"
- First hosted newsletter: Saladin fundraising announcement

### Documentation & Maintenance
- Fixed company lookup functionality in Newsletter Export Tool
- Cleaned up documentation files
- Maintained research input template and research log

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Autocomplete over Dropdown** - Better UX for 100+ companies, faster company selection
2. **Client-side Tools First** - Vanilla JS/HTML/CSS for MVP speed, defer Python automation
3. **GitHub Pages for Distribution** - Free, reliable hosting for newsletters without additional infrastructure
4. **Gitignore API Keys** - Security best practice, prevent accidental commits of Airtable credentials
