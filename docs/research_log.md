## 2026-01-14: Mao Ching Foo - Funding Societies Network

**Sources:**
- RealVantage team page: https://www.realvantage.co/our-team
- LinkedIn post by Anthony Poh (tagged Mao + Pramodh Rai)
- BRAVE Podcast Episode 96: https://www.jeremyau.com/blog/mao-ching-foo

**Key Findings:**
- Mao has 4+ verified ex-colleagues from Funding Societies, all now in senior roles
- His "trusted circle" includes Andy Kurnia (Chief Architect), Samuel Low (Director), both brought to RealVantage
- Pramodh Rai (now at Cyber Sierra) confirmed via LinkedIn tag
- Kelvin Teo (Funding Societies CEO) mentioned in podcast but no direct tag - borderline case

**Implications:**
- Funding Societies alumni network is a goldmine for warm intros
- Pattern: Mao brings trusted ex-colleagues to new ventures
- Tech background means his network is full of engineers/data scientists

**Actions Taken:**
- Added Mao to `people_companies` table
- Added 4 relationships to `people_relationships` table
- Decided to skip Kelvin Teo (no direct tag, will add if we profile him separately)

**Quality Check:**
- ✅ 4 door openers (target: 3+)
- ✅ All have clear working context
- ✅ All sources verified and accessible
- ✅ All are reachable (active LinkedIn)

**Time Spent:** 2 hours

## 2026-01-13: Keith Ong - Skipped (Inactive LinkedIn)

**Source:** Keith Ong's LinkedIn profile

**Finding:**
- Last post: 8 months ago
- Connections: < 100
- Work history: Sparse, focused on real estate investment (not tech)

**Implication:**
- Low value for recruiters who rely on LinkedIn outreach
- His network is primarily in real estate/investment, not tech ecosystem

**Decision:**
- Created ADR-004: Skip inactive LinkedIn profiles
- Will not profile Keith or similar non-tech founders

**Action:**
- Updated research criteria to check LinkedIn activity before deep research

- Co-founders: Keith Ong (CEO, real estate background), Mao Ching Foo (COO, tech background)
- Board includes Ng Beng Tiong (ex-ARA Asset Management)

**Decision:**
- Focus on Mao (tech background) over Keith (real estate background)
