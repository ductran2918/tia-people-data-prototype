# Research Input Template

**Purpose:** Standardized format for requesting founder research to minimize workload and save credits.

**For:** Team members submitting research requests to Manus or other researchers.

---

## Why This Template?

**Problem:** Starting research from scratch wastes time and credits.

**Solution:** Provide existing data upfront so research focuses only on finding relationships (Tier 1 + Tier 2).

**Time saved:** 10-15 minutes per founder  
**Credits saved:** ~30-40% (skip profile discovery, go straight to relationship mapping)

## Field Descriptions

### FOUNDER LINKEDIN URL (Required)
**Format:** Full LinkedIn profile URL  
**Example:** `https://www.linkedin.com/in/tkelvin/`

**Why required:** Primary identifier for the person. Must be exact URL.

**Tips:**
- Copy from browser address bar
- Include the trailing slash if present
- Don't use shortened URLs (e.g., `lnkd.in/...`)

---

### COMPANY SLUG (Required)
**Format:** Your internal company identifier from Tech in Asia database  
**Example:** `funding-societies`

**Why required:** Links founder to your existing company data.

**Tips:**
- Use lowercase, hyphen-separated format
- Check your startup database for the correct slug
- If company not in database, use company name in lowercase-hyphen format

---

### FOUNDER NAME (Recommended)
**Format:** Full name as shown on LinkedIn  
**Example:** `Kelvin Teo`

**Why helpful:** Saves 2-3 minutes of profile scraping. I can skip directly to relationship research.

**Tips:**
- Copy exactly from LinkedIn (don't abbreviate)
- Include middle names if shown
- Use English name if multiple names shown

---

### FOUNDER ROLE (Recommended)
**Format:** Current job title  
**Example:** `Co-founder & CEO`

**Why helpful:** Confirms they're the right person and helps categorize them.

**Tips:**
- Copy from LinkedIn's current position
- Include both titles if they have multiple (e.g., "Co-founder & CTO")
- Use "&" not "and" for consistency

---

### COMPANY WEBSITE (Recommended)
**Format:** Official company website URL  
**Example:** `https://fundingsocieties.com`

**Why helpful:** I can scrape team/investor pages directly instead of searching for them.

**Tips:**
- Use the main domain (not subdomains like `blog.company.com`)
- Include `https://` for consistency
- Verify it's the official site (not a news article about them)

---

### IS_FOUNDER (Recommended)
**Format:** `Yes` or `No`  
**Example:** `Yes`

**Why helpful:** Distinguishes founders from hired C-level executives.

**Tips:**
- `Yes` = Co-founder or Founder
- `No` = Hired CEO/CTO/etc. (joined after founding)
- Check LinkedIn's "Experience" section for founding date

---

### CO-FOUNDERS (Optional)
**Format:** Name and LinkedIn URL, one per line  
**Example:**
```
Reynold Wijaya (https://www.linkedin.com/in/reynoldwijaya/)
David Knott (https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidknott/)
```

**Why helpful:** I can immediately add them as Tier 2 relationships (cofounder type) without searching.

**Tips:**
- Only include current co-founders (not ones who left)
- Include LinkedIn URLs if you have them
- If you don't know, leave blank - I'll find them

---

### KNOWN INVESTORS (Optional)
**Format:** Investor names or firm names, comma-separated  
**Example:** `Sequoia Capital India, SoftBank Ventures Asia, Alpha JWC Ventures`

**Why helpful:** I can skip Crunchbase lookup and go straight to finding specific partner names.

**Tips:**
- Include firm names (e.g., "Sequoia Capital") not just "Sequoia"
- If you know specific partners (e.g., "Shailendra Singh from Sequoia"), include them
- Don't worry about completeness - I'll verify and find more

---

### BOARD MEMBERS (Optional)
**Format:** Names, one per line or comma-separated  
**Example:** `Pieter Kemps, John Doe`

**Why helpful:** These are high-value Tier 2 relationships. Providing them saves 5-10 minutes.

**Tips:**
- Check company website's "About" or "Team" page
- Include independent board members (not just investors)
- If unknown, leave blank

---

### RECENT FUNDING (Optional)
**Format:** `[Round], [Amount], led by [Investor], [Date]`  
**Example:** `Series C, $144M, led by SoftBank, Aug 2021`

**Why helpful:** Confirms company stage and gives me investor context.

**Tips:**
- Include most recent round only
- Approximate dates are fine (month + year)
- If no funding yet, write "Bootstrapped" or "Pre-seed"

---

### NOTES (Optional)
**Format:** Free text, any relevant context  
**Example:** `Focus on fintech connections. They're expanding to Indonesia.`

**Why helpful:** Guides my research focus and relationship prioritization.

**Tips:**
- Mention specific industries or regions if relevant
- Note any specific people you want me to look for
- Flag if this is urgent or high-priority
