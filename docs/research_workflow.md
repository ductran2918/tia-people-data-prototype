# Research Workflow

Step-by-step process for identifying "door openers" to tech founders.

---

## Step 1: Profile Selection

**Question:** Is this founder worth researching?

**Criteria:**
- Tech background (CTO, VP Eng, technical co-founder)
- Active LinkedIn (posted within 6 months)
- Company raised funding recently (growth signal)
- Southeast Asia based

**Time budget:** 10 minutes to evaluate

---

## Step 2: Relationship Discovery

**Question:** Who are their potential door openers?

**Source Priority (in order):**
1. **Company "Our Team" page** → Board members, advisors, senior team
2. **Founder's LinkedIn posts** (last 2 years) → Tags, mentions
3. **Podcast appearances** → People mentioned by name
4. **Funding announcements** → Investors quoted, people thanked

**Time budget:** 30 minutes

## Step 3: Relationship Validation

**Question:** Can this person actually open doors?

**"Door Opener" Criteria:**
- ✅ Direct working relationship (not just overlapping tenure)
- ✅ Founder publicly acknowledges them (tag, mention, credit)
- ✅ Still in contact (interaction within 2 years)
- ✅ Senior enough (C-level, VP+, Board, Investor)
- ✅ Reachable (active LinkedIn)

**Red Flags (Skip):**
- ❌ Worked at same company but no direct mention
- ❌ Junior employees (unless explicitly credited)
- ❌ Inactive LinkedIn (> 6 months)
- ❌ No mention in 5+ years

**Time budget:** 15 minutes per potential door opener

## Step 4: Data Entry

**Add to Airtable:**
1. Founder → `people_companies` table
2. Each validated door opener → `people_relationships` table
   - Use `related_person_id` if they're also a founder in database
   - Use `related_person_name` + `related_person_linkedin_url` if external
3. Fill `relationship_context` with narrative (where worked, what built, how long)
4. Add `source_url` for verification

**Time budget:** 20 minutes

---

## Step 5: Quality Check

**Standards:**
- Minimum 3 door openers per founder
- Each relationship has clear context ("worked together on X")
- All source URLs are accessible
- All related persons are reachable

**Time budget:** 5 minutes

---

## Total Time Budget: 1.5-2 hours per founder

**If exceeding 2 hours:** The founder may not have enough public information. Consider skipping.
